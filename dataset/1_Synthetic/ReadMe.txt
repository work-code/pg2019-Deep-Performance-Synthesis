Hi there, thank you for your attention of our work.

This folder contains the synthetic dataset, which is used in our experiment section.

Due to the fact that the file is too large (11.9GB), we have uploaded this dataset to the cloud drive.

The download link is: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bvY6IMSn1whv6C0fcAaxglkfm77My-Wt?usp=sharing

All you need do is prepare a good network to download the data. ^_^ 

These datas are collected from the paper [zhu et al. CVPR2018].

If you would like to use them in your research work, please cite the paper 

[zhu et al. CVPR2018]: Zhu, Hao, et al. View extrapolation of human body from a single image. CVPR2018.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.

You can open an issue through the button "Issues" on the github.

Thank you for your kind attention again.

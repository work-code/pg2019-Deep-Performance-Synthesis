Hi there, thank you for your attention of our work.

This is a detailed introduction of the real datasets used in our paper.

We collect four real actors T_samba, I_squat, Dan_Longjunmp3 and dance_pop.

Due to the fact that the authors of these datasets do not allow us to redistribute the datasets,

we will provide the links to download these datasets.

We feel deep sorry for this point.

T_smaba: https://people.csail.mit.edu/drdaniel/mesh_animation/

I_squat: https://people.csail.mit.edu/drdaniel/mesh_animation/

Dan_Longjunmp3: https://cvssp.org/data/cvssp3d/

dance_pop: https://cvssp.org/data/cvssp3d/

All you need do is prepare a good network to download the data. ^_^ 

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.

You can open an issue through the button "Issues" on the github.

Thank you for your kind attention again.

These tools are used for rendering PVHM models to color images, optical flows and depth maps.  The scripts are tested on Matlab 2017, Windows 10.  The color image renderer require 'Blender 2.79a' or higher version.  'Blender' is an open-source software and could be freely downloaded from https://www.blender.org/.  Detail usages could be found in the beginning of each m file:
./image_renderer/image_renderer.m
./depth_renderer/depth_renderer.m
./flow_renderer/flow_renderer.m
